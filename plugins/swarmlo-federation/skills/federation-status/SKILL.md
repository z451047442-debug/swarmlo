Show the current state of the federation.

Steps:
1. `npx -y -p @claude-flow/plugin-agent-federation@latest swarmlo-federation status` -- overall health
2. `npx -y -p @claude-flow/plugin-agent-federation@latest swarmlo-federation peers` -- list peers with trust levels and scores
3. Summarize: active sessions, messages exchanged, PII redactions, threat detections

Search memory for federation history:
`mcp__plugin_swarmlo-core_swarmlo__memory_search({ query: "federation peer trust", namespace: "federation" })`
