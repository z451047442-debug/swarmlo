## Context

`ruflo-core` is the **foundation plugin**. Every other plugin (`ruflo-ruvector`, `ruflo-agentdb`, `ruflo-browser`, `ruflo-intelligence`, `ruflo-adr`, `ruflo-aidefence`, `ruflo-autopilot`, plus 25 others) depends on the MCP server it registers via `.mcp.json` and the orchestration patterns it documents.

The current plugin contract (v0.2.6):

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — `version: "0.2.6"`, foundation and discovery metadata
- `.mcp.json` — registers `ruflo` MCP server via `npx -y @claude-flow/cli@latest`
- `agents/` — 4 generalists (`coder`, `researcher`, `reviewer`, `witness-curator`)
- `skills/` — 5 native skills (`init-project`, `ruflo-doctor`, `ruflo-status`, `discover-plugins`, `witness`)
- `commands/` — Claude commands for `ruflo-status` and `witness`, each paired with a same-name Codex skill
- `README.md` — documents installation, compatibility, MCP contract, sibling
  contracts, architecture decisions, and verification

The discover-plugins skill is a substantial asset — a curated 32-plugin catalog with decision guides. That stays.

What's missing matches the cadence we've established:

1. **No plugin-level ADR.** Foundation plugin should document its own contract since 30+ plugins depend on it.
2. **No smoke test.**
3. **No Compatibility section** pinning to `@claude-flow/cli` v3.6.
4. **MCP server tool count is undocumented.** `discover-plugins` mentions "314 tools" once, but this should be a contract claim with a verification path.
5. **No cross-references** to sibling ADRs (namespace convention, 3-gate pattern, 4-step pipeline) that other plugins now reference.

## Decision

### 1. Maintain this ADR (Accepted)

`docs/adrs/0001-core-contract.md`. Cross-links the seven sibling ADRs.

### 2. README augmentation (no rewrite)

Append:

- **Compatibility** — pin to `@claude-flow/cli` v3.6. Note the `npx -y @claude-flow/cli@latest` invocation in `.mcp.json` is the dynamic resolver; smoke verifies the resolved version.
- **MCP server contract** — the registered `ruflo` MCP server exposes 300+ tools across families: `memory_*`, `agentdb_*`, `embeddings_*`, `ruvllm_*`, `hooks_*`, `aidefence_*`, `neural_*`, `autopilot_*`, `browser_*`, `agent_*`, `swarm_*`, `system_*`, etc. Runtime truth via `mcp tool call mcp_status`.
- **Sibling contracts** — pointer block to the seven sibling ADRs that already define namespace convention, 3-gate pattern, 4-step pipeline, etc.
- **Architecture Decisions** + **Verification** sections.

### 3. Plugin metadata bump

`0.1.0 → 0.2.0`. Keywords add `foundation`, `mcp-server`, `plugin-catalog`, `discovery`.

### 4. Smoke contract (`scripts/smoke.sh`)

11 checks:

1. plugin.json declares `0.2.6` with the foundation keywords.
2. `.mcp.json` exists and registers a `ruflo` MCP server.
3. All 4 agents are present with valid frontmatter.
4. All 5 skills are present with valid frontmatter.
5. `discover-plugins` skill catalog references at least 25 sibling plugins (the curated catalog).
6. README pins to `@claude-flow/cli` v3.6.
7. README cross-references sibling contracts (namespace convention, 3-gate pattern, 4-step pipeline).
8. ADR-0001 exists with status `Accepted`.
9. `commands/ruflo-status.md` invokes `doctor` and `status`.
10. No skill grants wildcard tool access.
11. Every Claude command has a same-name Codex skill or a documented explicit exemption.

### 5. Cross-host hook and command compatibility

- PreToolUse telemetry always runs.
- Cursor retains its `{"permission":"allow"}` response.
- Codex plugin hooks are positively detected through Codex-specific
  `PLUGIN_ROOT` / `PLUGIN_DATA` variables and allow with exit 0 plus empty
  stdout, avoiding an invalid bare permission object.
- `/ruflo-status` remains unchanged for Claude Code. Codex discovers the
  same workflow through `skills/ruflo-status/SKILL.md`: run `doctor`, then
  `status`; run `doctor --fix` only after an explicit repair request.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Foundation plugin is now contractually self-documenting.
- Sibling-ADR cross-references make the cohesive plugin family discoverable from the entry point.
- Plugin catalog claims are now smoke-verifiable.

**Negative:**
- `discover-plugins` catalog must be kept in sync as plugins are added. Today there are 33 plugins (including this one); the catalog covers ~32. Drift remediation is a separate, mechanical task.

**Neutral:**
- No new MCP tools or agents. The status skill exposes an existing command
  workflow to Codex without changing the Claude command.

## Verification

```bash
bash plugins/ruflo-core/scripts/smoke.sh
# Expected: "11 passed, 0 failed"
```

## Implementation status

Plugin source version v0.2.6 is listed by path in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, so the marketplace artifact includes the five native skills and host-aware hook shim. Contract elements implemented: `.mcp.json` registers the `ruflo` server via `npx -y @claude-flow/cli@latest`; plugin-catalog discovery and Codex-native status skills are present; four generalist agents ship; command/skill parity and the remaining inventory are enforced by `scripts/smoke.sh`.
